<h1> The Start
</h1>
<img src="img/maple">
  <p class="example" >
  When I was 13 I started with simple drawings of what I thought would be just a phase.
  Eventually it became something bigger, like any other artist. The start is alwasy difficult,
  but the more I practiced, the more I liked it. I am not perfect on my art but I like it
  and I want to keep improving.
  For example:
  </p>
  <img src="img/!" 
  class="medium">
  <img src="img/2"
  class="Large">
  <p>
    This piece is a beginner look, wouldn't consider this good. However, it shows how much
    I have improved and how much my style ahs changed during the years.

  <h3> My Message </h3>
  <p>
    Nobody is perfect which means that everyone with effort can turn better. Any famous artist
    not matter if it was a comedy, painting, acting, writing, etc... Nobody started being perfect
    so even if we don't feel like our talent is enough with work it would be.
